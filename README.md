# Comparing-Linear-Regression-and-KNN-Regression-Model

Dataset: Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set 

Puropose: Using features of Power Plants (eg. Temperature) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant. 

Featurs including: Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V)



Predictions models used: Simple linear regression, Non-linear regression, KNN-regression

Result: KNN with normalized feature has best performance
